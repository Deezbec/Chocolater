## Want to create your own list?
1) Download the source code
2) Copy "generator.hmtl" and "list.csv" to "list editing" folder
3) Edit "list.csv" (I personally do this with VS code's "edit CSV" extension)\n
Columns stand for:
1st - Displayed package name
2nd - Chocolatey package name (its also used to get icons)
3rd - WinGet pack name (optional)
4th - What is icon on chocolatey package page extension (default - png)

Rows:
Can be devided to 2 categories:
1) Group
Groups can start with:  "*","&","%"
"*" - standart list
"&" - list without icon and chocolatey package link
"%" - standart compact list. Can be used to create pack's of programs
