Chocolater is simply a batch (.bat) script generator and it was conceived in order to facilitate the selection and installation of your favorite applications in one go.

Chocolater uses Chocolatey Software Management Tool to install all selected applications, and therefor Chocolatey will be installed too.

This is a Open Source project and we are not responsible in case of application failure or similar issues. All informations about Chocolatey can be found here [community.chocolatey.org](https://community.chocolatey.org "community.chocolatey.org")

As the generated script is a batch file, Microsoft defender will alert you and let you know that the app could put your PC at risk. If you don't trust my script, just close this TAB and move on. Everyone else can check out the generator.html that generates your downloaded script.
